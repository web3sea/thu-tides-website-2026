# Thu Tides

## Product Description

Thu Tides is a creative collaboration service connecting boutique hotels, homestays, dive resorts, and liveaboards with professional photography and video content creation. We help coastal and diving hospitality brands showcase their unique locations through stunning visual storytelling that captures the natural beauty of their surroundings.

## Target Audience

- Boutique hotels in coastal locations
- Homestays near beaches and waterways
- Dive resorts and diving operations
- Liveaboard vessels and boat-based hospitality

## Problems We Solve

### For Hospitality Brands
- **Limited marketing content**: Many boutique properties lack high-quality, professional visual content to showcase their unique locations and experiences
- **Budget constraints**: Smaller hospitality businesses often can't afford traditional agency rates for professional content creation
- **Generic marketing**: Stock photos and generic content fail to capture the authentic, unique character of their location and brand
- **Inconsistent content**: Without professional help, content quality varies and doesn't effectively tell their story

### Our Solution
Thu Tides provides professional photography and video content that captures the authentic beauty and unique experiences of coastal hospitality brands. Through barter or paid partnerships, we create awareness by showcasing travel experiences and artistic expression in natural surroundings, giving brands the visual storytelling assets they need to attract their ideal guests.

Additionally, we promote travel destinations through our Instagram following, providing partner brands with direct exposure to our engaged audience of travelers and adventure seekers.
